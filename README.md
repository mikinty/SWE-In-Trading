# SWE in Trading

What does it take to be a SWE in Trading / Quant? This is a comprehensive guide covering theory, problems, system design, as well as the inside scoop about what it's like to work in the industry.

Quant firms always say they want to hire "smart people," but what they really mean is someone with some combination of:

- You were a good student and understood concepts in your CS classes very deeply (CS Fundamentals, System Design)
- You were a competitive programmer and had deep knowledge of a programming language (usually C++) and can solve problems quickly (Algorithms, Languages)
- You have a very high IQ and can reason through concepts and think quickly without getting stuck (Problem Solving)

While you might already be panicking and feel like you don't hit any of the 3 criteria, you can train the first 2, and the IQ bit, you can change the way you approach problems and reason through them to get pretty proficient and being a great problem solver, despite your innate brain power.
