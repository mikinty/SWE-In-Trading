## SWE vs. Quant

The fundamental difference is that Quants are primarily responsible for _making money_, while SWEs make sure that systems run and develop features for traders/quants if needed. There are some things to unpack here

- Quants will likely have to code, and maybe a lot on their job. If they need to implement a strategy, run a backtest, etc, those are things they will probably code themselves unless they are really busy and then delegate to a SWE.
- It sounds like SWEs are 2nd-class citizens to Quants, and this is usually the case, even if companies don't say so. There is an exception to this, at companies where automated systems run all the trading, and there SWEs may be just as important, but overall, since SWEs aren't the ones "generating the alpha," they aren't the money makers and therefore make less and are less important. If you want to see this the other way, try to assign responsibilities for who made the money -- the more someone's reason is for the firm's profit, the more money they make and likely the more important they are as well.
- It is technically possible to transition to a Quant as a SWE, although it does take a certain type of team, company culture in terms of mobility, and person's ability. E.g. if you work on front-desk operations already as a SWE, there are naturally more opportunities to transition to doing more trading-related or quant activities, but if you are back-office and just run deep infra projects, you're probably not going to have a straightforward path into Quant.
